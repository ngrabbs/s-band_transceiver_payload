participant "Ground Station Console" as GSC
participant "Ground Station CAN Interface" as GSI
participant "ULL Payload RP2040" as RP
participant "LoRa Radio (SX1280)" as LR
participant "SDR Waterfall" as SDR

GSC -> GSI : Send CAN Frame\n(e.g. RUN TEST 1 with params)
GSI -> RP : Transmit CAN Frame (1 Mbps)
RP -> RP : Parse CAN Command
alt Command triggers data transmission
    RP -> RP : Retrieve data from SPI Flash\n(e.g. Image.bin)
end
RP -> LR : Send data to LoRa radio
LR -> SDR : Transmit RF Signal (2.4 GHz)
SDR -> GSC : Display signal on waterfall\n(optionally demodulate later)
note right of GSC
    Capture debug logs:
    - CAN traffic
    - RP2040 debug prints
    - SDR screenshots
end note
